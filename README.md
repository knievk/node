# node.nigar.io
This is the beta preview of my project nigar.io @ version 1.1.0
It is a game that is currently a Work in Progress and something that I am just doing in my free time.
Expect to see more updates in the future. I plan to work on nigar.io more in the future.
Don't expect a frequent, regular timetable for nigar.io because I have school.

Changelog:
 -implemented support for w,a,s,d keys usage
 -changed socket.emit setInterval (function() to allow for more frequent updates to the game not just by fps
 -begun progress on server.js and game.js
 -finished general game
